The Kepler GPU configuration file is a plain text INI file defining

the parameters of the Kepler model for a detailed (architectural)

configuration. This file is passed to Multi2Sim with the

'--kpl-config <file>' option, and should always be used together

with option '--kpl-sim detailed'.



The following is a list of the sections allowed in the GPU configuration

file, along with the list of variables for each section.
